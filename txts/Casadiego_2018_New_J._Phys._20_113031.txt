Abstract
Inferring direct interactions in complex networked systems from time series data constitutes a
challenging open problem of current research. Major obstacles include the often limited number of
time points accessible, unknown or inaccurate dynamical systems models in many practical
applications, the impossibility to infer topological information from invariant collective dynamics
such as synchronized states, and the required computational effort. Here, we propose and analyze a
mathematical scheme that transforms observed transient dynamics towards invariant states in to
accelerated reference frames to reveal network interactions. The transformation yields simple linear
constraints relating a number of short observed time series (of only a few data points) of the dynamics
to estimates the absence, presence and strength of direct physical interactions in a computationally
efﬁcient way. As we illustrate numerically, the scheme applies across transient dynamics towards
periodic and chaotic, phase-locked and other synchronized states. Reconstruction robustly reveals the
entire connectivity of network dynamical systems with increased reconstruction quality for large and
for sparse networks.

The collective dynamics of a networked system is shaped by its underlying interaction topology [1–8]. Yet,
whereas recording the dynamics of individual units of networks is becoming more accessible in experimental
settings, directly measuring the physical interaction topology of networks is often infeasible. Researchers
routinely resort to indirect methods to infer the physical interactions from the networks’ collective dynamics [9].
State-of-the-art approaches infer physical interactions via ODE modeling using large repertoire of functions
[10–14]. Such approaches require the entire dynamics to admit a sparse representation in the chosen repertoire,
which is difﬁcult to satisfy if no prior information is provided. More recent approaches bypass the need for
sparsity and reconstruct the full interaction topology by either imposing functional decompositions in grouped
variables [15], or by driving the network dynamics with known constant signals [16]. While the former strategy
carries along a high computational complexity that may become intractable in large networks, the latter
demands an accurate (and often infeasible) control of network dynamics.
Moreover, the dynamics of systems in invariant sets (such as synchronized states), for mathematical reasons,
is generically not capable of revealing complete topological interaction patterns [17–19]. This constraint comes
about because in invariant states, the dynamics of each unit exhibits a strict functional dependence on the
dynamics of the other units in the system such that the information contained in observed time series is
insufﬁcient for inferring interactions, no matter how many time series and how many data points per series are
observed. As a consequence, practical approaches [14, 20–24] exploit transient dynamics towards synchronized
or locked states such that the dynamics are not exactly invariant and do contain sufﬁcient information for
inferring network interactions, at least in principle. For simple classes of phase oscillators with constant, state-
independent frequencies exhibiting exactly phase-locked or fully synchronous dynamics, transforming time
series to a frame of reference that is co-moving with the dynamics is often possible by subtracting a term
−Ωt, containing the collective frequency Ω of the phase dynamics of each oscillator. However, such simple
transformations are useless if intrinsic oscillator frequencies and collective frequencies are state-dependent, if

individual oscillators have more than one variable and in particular if collective dynamics is non-periodic and
for instance chaotic.
In this article, we propose a tractable and model-free approach for inferring the interaction topology of
networks relying only on transient dynamics towards stable attractors such as synchronized or phase-locked
states. Speciﬁcally, we introduce the concept of accelerated reference frames (ARFs) in network dynamical
systems and show how a nonlinear transformation of time series by subtracting reference variables that are
accelerated and state-dependent themselves can reveal direct physical (as opposed to correlative statistical)
interactions. Reconstruction is feasible for dynamics towards phase-locked or otherwise synchronized states
with periodic or aperiodic and chaotic collective dynamics. Transformations in to co-moving ARFs enables
linearizations about ﬁxed points in the transformed dynamics, and thus mapping of the original inference
problem to one for transient relaxations towards linearly stable ﬁxed points. The ARF transformation thereby
opens up solving a previously hardly accessible range of inference problems in a computationally effective,
model-independent way.

1. Network inference on accelerated reference frames

To understand how ARFs aid in revealing the connectivity of networked systems, consider N coupled dynamical
units of the form

deﬁning the dependency structure in a graph-theoretic setting, is non-zero.
Our aim is to transform the dynamics (1) to new variables

Our goal is to identify which of the
iL are zero and thus where there is no direct physical interaction from j
onto i and which j
iL are one, indicating a direct interaction. We remark that the quality of the inference options
discussed below depend on the resulting transformation of interactions (7), as it depends on the degree the
relative inﬂuence of the ﬁrst term versus that of the second term in (7). This quality thus depends on the
dynamics of the accelerated frame also set by properties of the system dynamics fi, the ARF transformation
functions gi and on the actual size and sparsity of the network, as we will discuss shortly. Independent of those
details, the connectivity properties of the original system (1) should be identiﬁable if the second term in (7) is
sufﬁciently small. We need to carefully choose a reference frame to enforce a (ideally very strong) correlation
between C ij (·) and j
iL , reﬂecting the coupling between the accelerated and original dynamical variables.
The long term behavior of a range of systems exhibiting attractors with oscillatory, periodic or chaotic
dynamics, may be transformed to relaxations towards ﬁxed points if appropriate reference frames are chosen.
For instance, phase oscillators evolving towards phase-locked states (x t
) or identically
x t
synchronizing oscillators (x t
) may be considered as relaxing towards a ﬁxed point if we subtract
x t
0
the average state variable across all oscillators from each individual oscillator’s state, see ﬁgure 1 below. In such
ARFs, differences with respect to the average phase change as the system evolves towards the phase-locked state
and remain constant once the system reaches such ﬁnal state, see ﬁgure 1 for illustration.
In mathematical terms these properties mean that for such attractors there are functions g
:
for all i as t  ¥. Thus, we propose that an analogous system

2. Average network states as examples of Accelerated Reference Frames (ARFs)

As an illustrative example, consider the average over the units’ states to deﬁne an appropriate ARF for a class of
systems exhibiting transient dynamics towards phase-locked or otherwise synchronous dynamics. We start
focusing on phase-locking where x t

collective dynamics below. Examples of phase-locking systems are networks of phase oscillators and other
network dynamical systems exhibiting collective synchronization (where Δij=0 for all i, j in case of identical
synchronization).
We compute the average network state as

In particular, in locked-like states, all units move together with the same collective velocity, thereby y t

3. Reconstructing networks of phase-locking and synchronizing oscillators

To test our theory practically, we reconstructed the connectivity of coupled oscillators from their transient time
evolution towards some locked or synchronizing states. to start simple, we ﬁrst reconstructed directed networks
of Kuramoto oscillators, ﬁgure 3, [26, 27] with dynamics

Simulations of phase-locking oscillators (17) conﬁrm that (10) transforms their dynamics in to relaxations
towards ﬁxed points, ﬁgure 2. Inferring links from such relaxations via (9) demonstrates that our theory fully
distinguishes between existing and absent interactions, ﬁgure 3(a). Moreover, our results indicate that the
proxies obtained for the coupling strengths are strongly correlated with the actual coupling strengths employed
in simulations, ﬁgure 3(b).
To study the effects of network sparsity on our framework, we systematically reconstructed networks of
solving (9) via the Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse [25] and LASSO
different levels of sparsity s
1
n N
[31]. The latter is a standard regularization technique for ﬁtting sparse models to data. In our context, the
network connectivity represents the sparse model to ﬁt. Furthermore, to compare both methods, we evaluated
the quality of reconstructions in terms of the Area Under the Reciver-Operating Curve (AUC score) which is
equal to 1 for perfect reconstruction and equal to 1/2 for reconstructions equivalent to random guessing [32].
Our numerics show that the quality of reconstruction increases with networks of greater sparsity for both
Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse and LASSO, ﬁgures 4(a)–(b). However, the former shows best performance
for increasing number of trajectories (especially for dense networks), ﬁgures 4(a)–(c). Moreover, the

ni=10 and R=70. (a) Reconstructed proxies Jijˆ versus j for a single oscillator show that our theory distinguishes existing (green)
from absent (orange) interactions. The dashed lines illustrate threshold to distinguish both groups. (b) Reconstructed Jijˆ versus
original Jij show that the proxies are strongly correlated with original values.

Moore–Penrose pseudoinverse shows superior performance at separating existing from absent connections,
despite not being an approach speciﬁcally designed for variable selection as LASSO [31].
Can our theory reveal the connectivity of networks showing more complicated dynamics? Networks of
synchronizing dynamical systems may evolve in time with a common yet variable rate of change once the
network has relaxed back to the synchronized (locked-like) state.
Simulations of networks of synchronizing Rössler oscillators (18a) whose rate of change on the synchronized
state changes in time show again that (9) and (10) are effective at mapping the network evolution as ﬁxed point
dynamics and reveal the full network topology regardless of whether the oscillators operate in periodic or chaotic
regimes1, ﬁgure 5. These results are further supported by simulations of networks of Lorenz (19a) and Goodwin
(20a) oscillators. Speciﬁcally, we compared the reconstruction quality on such systems using ARF and using the
model-free algorithm for Inferring Network Interactions (ARNI) [15], ﬁgure 6. The results show that the ARF-
based theory proposed here requires smaller data sets than ARNI to reveal the full topology of both systems.
These results highlight the advantage of ARFs for inferring the structural connectivity of synchronizing network
dynamical systems.

To transform the synchronizing dynamics in to ﬁxed point dynamics, we computed averages for x
, x
and x
separately. In general, the
reconstruction process may be performed in all components. We here selected the component showing a clear distinction between groups of
existing and absent connections.

Summary and Conclusions. We presented a model-independent theory for inferring the interaction topology
of synchronizing networks from solely recording their transient collective dynamics. Speciﬁcally, we introduced
and exploited the concept of ARFs in the general context of network dynamical systems to reveal their full
interaction topology under sufﬁciently weak, otherwise uncontrolled external perturbations. In particular, we
demonstrated that accelerated frames may transform the dynamics of networked systems in to transient
relaxation dynamics towards ﬁxed points, which can readily be used for network inference. We illustrated this
idea on networks exhibiting phase-locking and synchronization and showed that our theory is robust to non-
trivial dynamical features such as periodic orbits with position-dependent velocities and collective chaos. For the
speciﬁc ARF deﬁned through network-wide state averages, the scheme exhibits optimal performance in the limit
of large sparse networks, i.e. n N
0
.
Whereas exactly synchronous or phase-locked dynamics in principle can generally not reveal the complete
network topology, inferring from transient dynamics towards synchrony or locking was so far restricted to
driving-response settings with known signals [16] or to general model-free approaches using a large repertoire of
functions [11, 12, 14, 15]. While the former strategy allows to create linear mappings from recorded dynamics to
network topology, the latter allows to infer links from transient dynamics following an unknown driving or
perturbation.

The theory presented in this article combines the advantages of both strategies simultaneously (i) allowing to
create linear mappings from dynamics to topology, and (ii) allowing to work with transients generated by
unknown drivings. It also reﬁnes the settings (ii) in the sense that fewer data points on trajectories are needed and
simultaneously less computational efforts. These advantages may make the ARF scheme a promising concept for
network inference in its own right.
Given that the theory only requires networks to operate around a steady state in some appropriate reference
frame, this technique may well be transferable to other systems if functions g(·) are appropriately designed. For
generalized settings such as delayed of generalized synchronization as well as other forms of spatio-temporally
ordered dynamics, such transformation functions need to be identiﬁed in the future and perhaps be constructed
on demand depending on the type of attractor the networked system describes, for instance by means of
expansions in basis functions or other techniques of model selection. The proposed theory may thus pave a novel
way for network inference applicable to a range of time series data obtained in systems where controlled driving
is infeasible, only short transients are available, or individual measurements are costly.
