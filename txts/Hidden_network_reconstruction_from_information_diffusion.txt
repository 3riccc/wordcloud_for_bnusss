Abstract—Learning about the structure of hidden or covert
networks is a major challenge in epidemiology, sociology, and
intelligence analysis. Vertices in hidden networks usually cannot
be enumerated or sampled in a systematic way; they can only
be revealed by tracing links emanating from already-observed
vertices. Observers sometimes cannot follow links directly, and
instead must rely on passive observation of a dynamic process
to reveal vertices and edges. This paper outlines a framework
for estimating network structures from partial observation of
information diffusion through the network. Diffusion is modeled
by a continuous-time Markov epidemic model. Edges are revealed
by transmission events and new vertices are uncovered when
information is transmitted to them. The approach is a gener-
alization of tools developed to reconstruct drug-user networks
from respondent-driven sampling studies in epidemiology. The
likelihood of the diffusion process can be interpreted as an
exponential random graph model. A Bayesian method for prob-
abilistic reconstruction of the transmission-induced subgraph is
described.

I . IN TRODUC T ION

Many social, organizational, and operational networks are
obscured from view and cannot be studied by comprehensive
census. When vertices can be randomly sampled, it is some-
times possible to estimate global or local graph properties from
a sampling-induced subgraph [1]–[8]. Unfortunately random
sampling of vertices or edges in a hidden network is often
impossible because no appropriate sampling frame is available.
When some or all vertices of a hidden network are observed,
explicit reconstruction often takes the form of link prediction
[9]–[14]. When most of the network is observed, but some
vertices are hidden or covert, it may be possible to detect
missing vertices [15]. When vertices or edges can be observed
in more than one sample, it is often possible to combine
information across samples to reconstruct subgraphs or esti-
mate global graph properties [16]–[18]. However, estimation
techniques that are effective under random sampling do not
necessarily perform well under other observation scenarios
[19]. In particular, estimates of global graph properties from
observed vertices – such as the degree distribution – may be
strongly affected by the sampling procedure [20], [21].
Hidden or covert networks can typically only be studied
by tracing links from one vertex to another. Link-tracing

survey techniques have gained wide use in epidemiology and
sociology for studies of hidden or hard-to-reach populations
[22], [23]. Often social stigma serves to obscure members of
hidden populations; sometimes the fear of legal repercussions
keeps individuals hidden. Respondent-driven sampling (RDS)
[23] is a link-tracing procedure that has found wide use
in epidemiology, sociology, and public health research on
drug users. RDS has also been proposed to study domestic
extremism and counterinsurgency [24]–[26].
Link-tracing studies aim to discover new nodes and the
connections between them. When the link-tracing process
constitutes a sampling design, it is possible to estimate global
properties of the network and characteristics of the population
of vertices [27]. There is evidence that data from link-tracing
studies can have very different properties from data obtained
by random sampling of vertices [28]–[30]. In link-tracing
studies, not every link between sampled nodes is observed;
usually only links that are traced can be observed, and it is
unclear whether analysts can hope to estimate properties of
the local or global networks from networks observed in this
way.
Worse, the mechanism that reveals links is often not under
the control of the observer. For example, in RDS subjects “re-
cruit” other subjects to whom they are connected in the target
population social network. As another example, an intelligence
analyst might intercept a message diffusing through a covert
network. In this idealization, vertices and edges are revealed
to the observer only when an action – such as communication
or transmission of information – happens across the edge. If
no transmission happens across a given edge, the edge is not
revealed to the observer. Likewise, if no transmission reaches
a given vertex, that vertex is not revealed to the observer.
Despite these limitations, passive observation of deterministic
or stochastic communication processes on links has been
effectively used to provide insight into the structure of hidden
or partially obscured networks [31]–[34]. The key insight in
this work is that the path and dynamics of a process on a
hidden network can reveal properties of the network itself.
This paper outlines a general strategy for probabilistic
reconstruction of the edges in a hidden network from obser-
vation of an information diffusion process on that network.
Information diffusion is modeled by a continuous-time Markov
susceptible-infected model [35]. This work is disctinct from

“diffusion” methods for distributed learning over networks
[36]–[38]. The technique is a generalization of tools developed
for epidemiological research on networks of drug users from
data obtained by RDS link tracing [39]. First, a class of
Markov transmission processes is deﬁned, along with the
data observed from the process. Vertices are observed when
information is transmitted to them; edges are visible only
when a transmission event takes place across them. The notion
of “transmission” is general:
it can refer to any one-way
communication process that changes the state of the individual
who receives the transmission, and in which the receiver can
also transmit the information to its network neighbors. Passive
observation of this type of communication processes can reveal
important properties of network structures. A Bayesian method
for probabilistic reconstruction of the transmission-induced
subgraph is derived.

A. Preliminaries

Suppose we wish to learn about the structure of an undi-
rected graph G = (V , E ), where the vertex set V has ﬁnite
size |V | = N < ∞ and the edge set E contains no self-
loops or parallel edges. A vertex’s degree is the number
of edges incident to it that connect to other vertices in the
hidden network G. The terms “graph” and “network”, “vertex”
and “node”, and “edge” and “link” are used interchangeably.
The graph could represent a social network, an organizational
structure, or relationships between any entities of interest.
A stochastic model of one-way information diffusion on the
edges of G is constructed in a manner analogous to the
susceptible-infected model of infectious disease epidemiology
[35]. The term “diffusion” refers to the spread or transmission
of a state, message, or object along the edges of G.
Suppose that each vertex i ∈ V has a property or state Xi (t)
which is a function of time t > 0. In this paper, it is assumed
for simplicity that Xi (t) ∈ {0, 1}, but this restriction could be
relaxed. A vertex in state 1 at time t has already received the
message, and can transmit it; a vertex in state 0 has not yet
received it. Assume that at time t = 0, the set of vertices M
with Xi (0) = 1 for i ∈ M , is known. We refer to members
of M as “seeds”.

Deﬁnition 1 (Susceptible vertices and edges). A vertex j ∈ V
is susceptible to transmission at time t if Xj (t) = 0 and there
exists least one i ∈ V such that Xi (t) = 1 and {i, j } ∈ E .
An edge {i, j } ∈ E is susceptible at time t if Xi (t) = 1 and

Xj (t) = 0 or Xi (t) = 0 and Xj (t) = 1.

The time to transmission along a susceptible edge is assumed
to follow a common probability distribution. Consider two
distinct vertices i ∈ V and j ∈ V with {i, j } ∈ E . At time
t = 0, assume that Xi (0) = 1 and Xj (0) = 0. Transmission
happens independently across the edge connecting i and j at
a random time

degrees. In particular, the analyst does not observe the full network G, nor

where λ > 0 is the rate of transmission across a single
susceptible edge.

B. Observation

Suppose the vertex i ∈ V becomes known to an observer
at time ti = argmint {t : Xi (t) = 1} when it ﬁrst receives
a transmission. The degree di of i in G is fully observed.
By assumption, the observer does not have direct access to
any vertices or edges in G; instead, the path of a stochastic
transmission process on the edges of G is revealed over time.

Deﬁnition 2 (Transmission graph). The directed transmission
graph is GT = (VT , ET ), where VT ⊂ V is the set of n
known vertices and a directed edge (i, j ) ∈ ET indicates that
i transmitted a message to j .

It is assumed that vertices cannot receive a transmission more
than once, so GT is acyclic. This assumption can be relaxed
with some increase in notation and computation. Furthermore,
GT need not be connected if the set of seeds has |M | > 1.
While the directed transmission graph GT is fully observed,
the subgraph of observed vertices is not visible, since an edge
between vertices in VT is not visible unless a transmission
event took place across that edge.

Deﬁnition
3
(Transmission-induced
subgraph).
The
transmission-induced subgraph is an undirected graph
GS = (VS , ES ), where VS = VT consists of n sampled
vertices, and {i, j } ∈ ES if and only if i ∈ VS , j ∈ VS , and

{i, j } ∈ E .

From this deﬁnition, it is evident that the recruitment graph
GT is a directed subgraph of GS .

Deﬁnition 4 (Transmissibility matrix). Let T be a n×n matrix
whose element Tij is 1 if vertex i can transmit the information
just before the time of the j th transmission event, and zero
otherwise. The rows and columns of T are ordered by the
time at which each subject is observed.

Let d be the time-ordered n × 1 vector of subjects’ degrees
in the order they are observed and let t = (t1 , . . . , tn ) be the
n × 1 vector of transmission times, where t1 < · · · < tn .
The observed data from the transmission process consists of

Tij ∼ Exponential(λ),

(1)

Y = (GT , d, t, T).

181

Figure 1 illustrates the observed data and their relationship
to the unobserved population graph G. Since the transmission
graph GT does not contain any edges along which a trans-
mission event did not take place, the transmission-induced
subgraph GS is not fully observed. However, observation of
GT and d places constraints on the topology of GS .

C. Likelihood

To derive the likelihood of the observed data on a hidden
network, it is necessary to formalize the class of reconstructed
networks for which the likelihood makes sense.
Deﬁnition 5 (Compatibility). A subgraph bGS = (VS , bES ) is
compatible with the transmission graph GT if

1) for each (i, j ) ∈ ET , {i, j } ∈ bES ;

2) the degree of i ∈ VS in GS does not exceed the observed
total degree di in G.
Intuitively, an estimated subgraph bGS is compatible with GT
if GT is a (directed) subgraph of GS and the degree of each
vertex in GS is less than or equal to its degree in G. Let
w = (0, t1 , t2 − t1 , . . . , tn − tn−1 ) be the n × 1 vector of inter-
transmission waiting times and let A be the n × n adjacency
matrix of bGS , with the rows and columns representing vertices
in the order they were observed. Let u be an n×1 vector whose
ith element is the number of edges connecting i to unobserved
vertices in G, so ui = di − Pn
Aij . Figure 2 shows the
matrices used to compute the likelihood. The joint likelihood
of GT and w can be expressed in a computationally convenient
form without explicitly enumerating susceptible edges. The
likelihood is given by

j=1

L(GT , w|GS , d, λ) = λn−|M | exp[−λs′w]

(2)

where

s = lowerTri(AT)′1 + T′u

(3)

Crawford (2015) gives a proof [39]. The statistic s is a n × 1
vector whose ith element is the number of susceptible edges
in GS just before the ith transmission event.

A. Exponential random graph models

The likelihood (2) can be interpreted as a function of the
adjacency matrix A, with w and λ held ﬁxed. We can rewrite
(2) as

Pr(A) =

exp[s(A)′θ ]
κ(θ)

(4)

where s(A) is a vector-valued function of A given by (3),
θ = −λw, and κ(θ) is a normalizing constant that does
not depend on A. The interpretation (4) reveals that
the
likelihood of the observed data constitutes an exponential
random graph model (ERGM) for the unobserved portion of
the transmission-induced subgraph GS [40], [41]. ERGMs
have several desirable computational properties: it is straight-
forward to simulate realizations from (4) via Gibbs sampling
or Metropolis-Hastings steps; to compute the ratio of proba-
bilities of two estimated graphs, only a change statistic needs
to be calculated [42].

B. Generating a compatible estimate

Given a compatible graph GS = (VS , ES ) with correspond-
ing vector u, another compatible estimate can be obtained by
randomly choosing two vertices i and j with ti < tj such
that no transmission event took place from i to j , that is,
(i, j ) /∈ ET . If {i, j } /∈ ES , ui > 0 and uj > 0, then a new
edge {i, j } is proposed. If {i, j } ∈ ES , then it is proposed
to remove the edge {i, j } from ES . The resulting proposal
graph is identical to GS except that the edge {i, j } has either
been added or removed. Furthermore, since this procedure
does not change transmission edges in GT , the proposal graph
is compatible with the observed data, by Deﬁnition 5.
The number of compatible subgraphs G∗
S that can be
produced from GS by this procedure is
nchanges(GS ) = X

i<j

1{{i, j } /∈ ES , ui > 0, uj > 0}

+ 1{{i, j } ∈ ES , (i, j ) /∈ ER }.

(5)

The probability of producing any particular compatible sub-
graph G∗
S is

Pr(G∗
S |GS ) =

1

nchanges(GS )

.

(6)

This probability will be useful in forming the Metropolis-
Hastings ratio for G∗
S below.

C. Computing the likelihood ratio

Suppose ﬁrst that GS has no edge between i and j , {i, j } /∈
ES . For a proposal G+
S ) identical to GS except
S , the likelihood ratio is

S = (VS , E+

that {i, j } ∈ E+
L(GT , w|G+
S , d, λ)
L(GT , w|GS , d, λ)

= e2λ(tn−tj ) .

(7)

Now suppose GS has and edge between i and j , {i, j } ∈ ES
with {i, j } /∈ ET . For a proposal G−
S ) identical to
GS except that {i, j } /∈ E−
S , the likelihood ratio is

S = (VS , E−

L(GT , w|G−
S , d, λ)
L(GT , w|GS , d, λ)

= e−2λ(tn−tj ) .

Fig. 3. Example Bayesian reconstruction of transmission-induced subgraph GS from simulated transmission process. The network data are from a study of
social, sexual, and drug use links between individuals in Colorado Springs, CO, USA from 1988-1990. An information diffusion process is simulated through
the network with |M | = 1 seed, n = 50 total observations, and transmission rate λ = 2. The prior parameters for λ are α = 1, β = 0.57, and the sparsity
penalty is γ = 1.77. The top row shows the true transmission-induced subgraph GS , with transmission edges shown in black and unobserved edges in gray.
The adjacency matrices of GT , GS , and a random draw bGS from the posterior distribution are also shown. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve
is shown with the area under the curve (AUC) indicating good overall reconstruction accuracy. The posterior traces of the number of edges, λ, and susceptible
edges are shown. True values are given in green.

These expression are simple and do not require the any
matrix computation implied by (2) and (3). Furthermore, the
differences tn − tj can be computed in advance and stored for
repeated use.

D. Prior for GS

While the likelihood (2) helps determine which edges be-
long in GS , point estimates or Bayesian posterior estimates
can contain more edges than the true GS . It is clear from (7)
and (8) that addition of a new edge {i, j } in GS is favored
over sending both pendant edges to unobserved vertices not
in GS . A prior distribution for GS is therefore helpful to
ensure the desired sparsity. A convenient class of priors is
Pr(GS ) ∝ exp[−γ |ES |], where γ > 0 is chosen to penalize
dense graphs. Given GT and d, we have the inequalities

n − |M | ≤ |ES | ≤

1

i=1

di ,

(9)

and these bounds can be used to specify γ . The lower bound is
sharp (it is the number of edges in the transmission subgraph
GT ), while the upper bound could be tightened with speciﬁc
knowledge of d. Let p = (cid:0)n − |M | + 1
2 (cid:1) be
a crude estimate of the density of GS . Then letting γ =
− log[p/(1 − p)] gives a convenient sparsity penalty without
imposing undue assumptions on the topology of GS .

E. Algorithm

Using the results given above, it is possible to reconstruct
the transmission-induced subgraph GS and observed vertices’

connections to unobserved vertices in G with reasonable accu-
racy. By alternately drawing from the conditional distributions
of GS and λ, a Gibbs sampling algorithm is derived. First
suppose λ is held ﬁxed, and GS is a compatible subgraph
estimate. From this estimate, a new compatible subgraph G∗
is formed using the procedure outlined in Section III-B. Then
we compute the Metropolis-Hastings ratio

S |GS )

(10)

and accept G∗
S if this ratio is greater than 1. Otherwise, we
accept G∗
S with probability equal to this ratio.
Next, suppose GS is ﬁxed and we wish to sample λ. We
employ a Gamma prior for λ with π(λ) ∝ λα−1 e−βλ where
α > 0 and β > 0. Then π(λ) is a conjugate prior for the
likelihood (2), and the conditional posterior distribution of λ
is Gamma(α + n − |M |, β + s′w). Therefore, we can sample
λ directly from its conditional posterior distribution.

GS . The network G = (V , E ) is derived from a network study
of social, sexual, and drug use links between individuals in
Colorado Springs, CO, USA from 1988-1990 [43]–[45] with
|V | = 5492 and |E | = 43288. An information diffusion
process is simulated on G with |M | = 1 seeds, n = 50
observations, and λ = 2. The prior for λ is Gamma with
α = 1, β = 0.57 (giving prior mean E[λ] = 2), and
the sparsity penalty is γ = 1.77. The marginal edge-wise
posterior distribution of GS is used to assess reconstruction

induced subgraph GS with transmission edges in black and
unobserved edges in gray; GT , GS , and a random draw bGS

shows the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve with
area under the curve (AUC) 0.83, indicating good reconstruc-
tion accuracy. Next, the number of edges in the reconstructed
estimates bGS , estimates of λ, and the number of susceptible
edges in bGS are shown, with true values given in green
lines. Gray dashed lines in the trace of edge counts denote
the minimum and maximum edge counts given GT and d
described in (9). A modiﬁed application of this approach to
drug user networks is given by [39].

V. CONC LU S ION S

Mapping of covert networks is an important task in intel-
ligence analysis and threat detection [46], [47]. Discovery of
nodes and links can be challenging, especially when analysts
must rely on passive observation for insight. This paper has
shown that observation of a diffusion process can reveal
topological properties of a hidden network. Two features of
the proposed method yield desirable inferential properties.
First, compatibility (in the sense of Deﬁnition 5) induces
strong topological constraints on estimated subgraphs, but
without additional insight, all such compatible subgraphs have
the same probability. Second, the likelihood of a stochastic
diffusion process can used to distinguish between compatible
topologies, providing more weight to those that occur with
higher probability under the diffusion model. Furthermore, it
may be possible to extend the proposed tools for estimating
the transmission-induced subgraph to estimation of features of
the unobserved parts of the super-population graph G. When a
model is speciﬁed for the global network, the sampled portion
of the graph can sometimes be used to probabilistically impute
the remaining part [48].
The stochastic model of information diffusion employed
here is simple and parsimonious, and is based on widely used
models of epidemic processes on graphs. More complicated
models that
incorporate loss of transmissibility (entailing
changes to the structure of the transmissibility matrix T), or
preferential transmission between certain types of vertices are
possible with little additional computational burden. However,
assumptions required by more complicated models may not be
justiﬁable when aspects of the diffusion process are not known
with certainty, and a balance is necessary between realism and
parsimony.
